# A little bit about my application

This is my Employee Polls Application. The application was created using a "_DATA.js file which represents a fake database and lets you access the data as well as React/Redux.
You can login with your username and password. This will take you to the dashboard where there are answered and unanswered questions. You can view qustions as well as answer them. You can also create a new poll with your own questions of would you rather. There is also a leaderboard to see the amount of votes that has been cast by the users within the polls. You can logout as well when you are done. The project is bootstrapped using Create React App using a Redux template.
